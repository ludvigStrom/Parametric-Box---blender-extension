# Parametric Box - Blender 2.8 extension
When I model I tend to create alot of boxes that I begin from. It's often a pain to change the origin for modeling and scale it to right size. 
This simple script eliminates those steps and adds a box that is independently scalable in x,y,z at creation with local origin at 0,0,0

# Install:
Run script
You will now find 'Box Parametric' under View3D > Add > Mesh > Box Parametric
